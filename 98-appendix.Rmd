# Git Setup

To participate in the git lesson,
you need to:

1. Download and install
    - [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
    - [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
    - git:
	    - [Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) - to install see section \@ref(git-windows) below.
		- [OS X &ge; 10.9](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/)
		- [OS X &le; 10.8 snow-leopard](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/)
2. Setup your SSH RSA key if necessary in RStudio -
   only if your **SSH RSA key** is **(none)**, then
   click on the button to **Create RSA key...**
3. Have a [github.com](https://github.com) account, and
4. Copy your SSH RSA key to github.com -
   in the RStudio window below click on **View public key**
   and copy the public key to your account as explained in step 2 onwards:
   https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

To quickly check that you are fully setup, in RStudio, open
**Tools > Global Options... > Git/SVN** and check
that RStudio sees values for **Git executable** and
**SSH RSA key**.

```{r RStudio git settings, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-git-settings.png")
```
