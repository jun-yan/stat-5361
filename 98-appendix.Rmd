# Git Setup

To participate in the git lesson,
you need to:

1. Install
    - R
    - RStudio
    - git
2. Setup your SSH keys in RStudio, and
3. Have a [github.com](https://github.com) account

To quickly check that your setup, in RStudio, open
**Tools > Global Options... > Git/SVN** and check
that RStudio sees values for **Git executable** and
**SSH RSA key**

```{r RStudio git settings, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-git-settings.png")
```
