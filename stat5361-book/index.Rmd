# Prerequisites

We assume that students can use R/Rstudio comfortably. If you are new to R, an extra amount of hard work should be devoted to make it up. In addition to the official documentations from the R-project, the presentations at a [local SIAM workshop] (https://siam.math.uconn.edu/events/) given by Wenjie Wang, a PhD student in Statistics, can be enlighting:

- <https://github.com/wenjie2wang/2018-01-19-siam>
- <https://github.com/wenjie2wang/2018-04-06-siam>

The homework, exam, and project will be completed by __R Markdown__. Following the step by step the instructions in Yihui Xie's online book on __bookdown__ at <https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/>, you will be amazed how quickly you can learn to produce cool-looking documents and even book manuscripts. If you are a keener, you may as well following Yihui's __blogdown__, see online book <https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/>, to build your own website using R Markdown.


All your source code will be version controlled by __git__ and archived on __GitHub__. RStudio has made using git quite straightforward. The online tutorial by Jenny Bryan, Happy Git and GitHub for the useR, is a very useful tool to get started

## A Likelihood Estimation Example

In mathematical statistics, we have learned that, under certain regularity conditions, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is consistent, asymtotically normal, and most efficient. The asymptotic variance of the estimator if the inverse of the Fisher information matrix. Speficially, let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be a random sample from a distribution with density $f(x; \theta)$, where $\theta$ is a parameter. How do we obtain the MLE?

```{r mle}
set.seed(123)
n <- 100
x <- rgamma(n, scale = 2, shape = 4)
hist(x)
```
