# Optimization {#optim}

Recall the MLE example in Chapter \@ref{prelim}.
Consider a random sample $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ of size $n$ coming from a
univariate distribution with density function $f(x| \theta)$, where
$\theta$ is a parameter vector. The MLE $\hat\theta$ of the unknown
parameter $\theta$ is obtained by maximizing the loglikelihood
function
\[
L(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \log f(X_i | \theta)
\]
with respect to $\theta$.
Typically, $\hat\theta$ is obtained by solving the score equation, the
derivative of the loglikelihood function equated to zero.
